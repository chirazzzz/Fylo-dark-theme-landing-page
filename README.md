This is landing page with dark theme which I created while following a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Running Locally

Since this site is made with HTML and CSS it doesn't require any setup or installing NPM modules. Simply clone or fork the repo onto your local machine and open the index.html file using your web browser. It looks great in Chrome, Firefox and Safari!

## Description

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Example below:

![Design preview for the Fylo landing page with dark theme and features grid challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

The designs are in JPG static format which meant that I needed to use my best judgement for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There was also a `style-guide.md` file, which provided a color palette and fonts families.


### Challenges

-  Only working from static design files was tough however I was able to perceive differences in spacings and sizes and match the designs perfectly.
- This was the first site I created fully on my own (I have since created many more!) so thinking about the right way to approach the project was daunting. This also made me feel incredibly satisfied when I was able match the designs.

### Future Plans

I want to recreate more challenges using Frontend Mentor to continue advancing my abilities. I'd love to utilise React and Tailwind to create more complex challenges which require more logic, state etc.

## Overview

### My goals

The site should:

- Perfectly match the designs in the `/design` folder on both mobile and desktop screens
- Look beautiful at any screen size and orientation

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Work Flow

I looked through the designs to start planning out how I'd tackle the project. This step was crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes that I could create to make reusable styles.

Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing the HTML first helped focus my attention on creating well-structured content. Next I wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

The bulk of the this project involved CSS so I started adding styles to the top of the page and worked my way down. I made sure to only move on to the next section once I was  happy I'd recreated the design.

### What I learned

My biggest takeaway from this project was getting the sense of how far I'd come and what I could build. This was the first big project I worked on alone and I was delighted to recreate the design so closely.

I really appreciated the importance of planning instead of jumping into coding. I've detailed my work flow above because I forced myself to be more methodical and it really paid off.
